# turfcoach-app
Technical challenge for Turfcoach

To run locally:
1. Clone repo and open in vscode (or editor of your choice) using git clone (url here)
2. Run npm install in server and client
3. Insert your https://openweathermap.org/api API key in WeatherBox component
4. run npm start in server and client

Follow-up questions:
1. I used create-react-app to create the framework and Tailwind for styling. In all honesty, I used create-react-app simply because it's what we used at Ironhack and I'm familiar with how it operates. Tailwind was new to me, but very intuitive.
2. I think it'd be fun to add time restrictions for caretakers: obviously John can't be mowing Pitch 1 and irrigating Pitch 2 simultaneously. I also chucked in a couple buttons to hide the activity form and weather forecast for the sake of aesthetics, but that's just a matter of preference.
3. I spent way more time on populating the edit forms with values than I'd like to admit, and it took me a second to figure out a less code-intensive means of allowing only one Pitch to be used at a time, but I probably spent most of my time on styling before I dug into Tailwind.
4. I'd make it prettier, certainly, but I think it performs perfectly well as-is.

Feedback:
1. That was fun! This challenge gave me an opportunity to look through old projects, dissect what I'd done previously with similar applications, and come up with more elegant solutions to problems such as the Pitch restrictions.
